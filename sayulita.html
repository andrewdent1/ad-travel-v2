                feel and relaxed atmosphere. Sayulita offers an abundance of colorful streets, art galleries, and

            <p>Sayulita Plaza is a gathering area located in the heart of Sayulita. Sayulita Plaza is a focal point of
                the town and serves as a hub for various activities and events. The plaza often hosts artisan markets,
                live music performances, cultural events, and festivals, making it an integral part of the Sayulita's
                cultural and social life. </p>

            <h2 class="section-subhead">Beaches in Sayulita</h2>
            <p>Playa De Los Muertos and Playa Las Cuevas are my two favorite beaches in Sayulita. Both are more
                low-key and less crowded than Playa Sayulita (which is located in the heart of town). Playa De Los
                Muertos is about a 10 minute walk from town and Playa Las Cuevas is about a 45 minute
                walk from town.</p>
