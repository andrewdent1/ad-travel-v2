        <h1>Welcome to Siena!</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The city of Siena is one that will exceed your expectations. Built in the 1200's, this Tuscan hill town
                will transport you back to the Middle Ages. Siena is well-known for its cuisine, art, museums, medieval
                architecture, and the Palio, Siena's iconic semi-annual horse race. In this guide we’ll be sharing the
                best way to do Siena all in one day.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="day1">
        <div class="day-text">
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Getting to Siena</h2>
            <p>It is a common misconception that Siena is only possible to visit if you are traveling with a car. This
                misconception isn't 100% inaccurate, but Siena is still obtainable by train or bus. Siena's train
                station is very small, meaning that trains aren't super frequent. There is a train from Florence to
                Siena that takes about an hour and a half and costs about €12. There are also buses for about the same
                price but tend to take a little longer.</p>
            <p>If you are arriving by car, there are many parking lots located around the city that are open to the
                public. Some of these lots are free and some are paid, just make sure to check before leaving your car.
                If you are arriving by train or bus, you'll be dropped off on the north side of the city, about a 30
                minute walk from the city center. This walk to the city center is 80% uphill, which is why I recommend
                catching a taxi from the station. A taxi from the train station to Piazza del Campo should cost you no
                more than €15. Piazza del Campo is where our day will begin.</p>

            <h1 class="section-head">Things to Do</h1>
            <br>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Avenida Revolucion</h2>
            <p>Avenida Revolución is a historic and bustling street in the city center known for its markets, shops,
                restaurants, bars, and vibrant atmosphere. It has been a significant tourist and commercial area in
                Tijuana for many years. </p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Sayulita Plaza</h2>
            <p>Sayulita Plaza is a gathering area located in the heart of Sayulita. Sayulita Plaza is a focal point of
                the town and serves as a hub for various activities and events. The plaza often hosts artisan markets,
                live music performances, cultural events, and festivals, making it an integral part of the Sayulita's
                cultural and social life. </p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Mercado de Artesanias Sayulita</h2>
            <p>Mercado de Artesanias Sayulita is a traditional market known for authentic Mexican goods. This market is
                a perfect place to grab a souvenir or a bite to eat. Hours vary, but the market is generally open on
                weekends.</p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Monkey Mountain: Patzcuaro Trailhead</h2>
            <p>Monkey Mountain was my favorite hike in the area and can be reached by car or taxi. For a full guide on
                Monkey Mountain, please see the link <a
                    href="https://www.awaygowe.com/cerro-del-mono-monkey-mountain-sayulita/">here</a>.</p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Beaches in Sayulita</h2>
            <p>Playa De Los Muertos and Playa Las Cuevas are my two favorite beaches in Sayulita. Both are more
                low-key and less crowded than Playa Sayulita (which is located in the heart of town). Playa De Los
                Muertos is about a 10 minute walk from town and Playa Las Cuevas is about a 45 minute
                walk from town.</p>

            <h1 class="section-head">Places to Eat</h1>
            <br>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Don Pedro's</h2>
            <p>Don Pedro's is my favorite spot in town. I visited Don Pedro's on my first day in Sayulita and I found
                its ambience hard to beat. There was live music and people dancing, creating a welcoming entrance upon
                arrival. We were sat at a table in the sand and watched one of the best sunsets I've ever experienced.
                The food is the definition of authentic. A must-try from Don Pedro's is their assortment of seafood
                tostadas.</p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Tierra Viva</h2>
            <p>Tierra Viva is a traditional restaurant that offers a wide selection of food for an affordable price.
                This spot is known for its authentic Mexican cuisine and wide variety of tequila. Group tequila tastings
                are available and take place on the terrace of the restaurant.</p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Paris Delights</h2>
            <p>Paris Delights is your typical Parisian cafe located in Sayulita known for their large assortment of
                traditional treats and pastries. My personal favorite from this spot is the chocolate almond croissant.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Northside Cafe</h2>
            <p>Northside Cafe is a perfect spot if you are looking for a quick, easy, and affordable breakfast. This
                spot is known for its large presence of expats, and serves as a hotspot for locals and visitors alike.
                Northside offers a large menu of breakfast favorites.</p>
            <h2 class="section-subhead">Rollado Ice Cream</h2>
            <p>Rollado is an amazing ice cream spot located in their iconic pink truck. The ice cream is rolled fresh
                and made-to-order. Their iconic "ice cream tacos" are rolled ice cream served in a waffle cone, and are
                a must try.</p>
